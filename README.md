Hello! My name is Luis and for a little over 5 years, I have helped businesses increase their revenue by optimizing their websites and online presence.

I would say the highlights of my career stem back to 2018, when I was presented the opportunity to work with multi-millionaire entrepreneur Grant Cardone in the city of Aventura, and in 2020, where despite all the crazy events such a year brought us, I began working for the Dan Marino Foundation as their new Web Developer.

One of my biggest hobbies is linguistics. A couple of years ago, I wrote a book on English grammar and phonology called "Road to Fluency", which aims to teach Spanish speakers all the secrets of the English language. Additionally, I work on an online platform, FluidezEnIngles.com, where I help people learn different techniques to improve their English pronunciation. I am also a fan of music from soundtracks and all forms of storytelling.
